Basic Overview: 
The file labeled "text_based_risk - Copy" is a version of the game without the graphics, because the graphics turned out to be a lot harder than we anticipated it would be. The game is in the terminal, and it goes through Player 1 and Player 2's turns until one player gets all the territories available. In the beginning, the player is given a certain number of armies, normally 2, and the player is given a list of their territories and each territory's enemy borders. The player can put the armies wherever they want, and they can choose to attack other territories or not. If the player chooses to attack, they select where they want to attack from and who they want to attack. A player can't attack from a territory with fewer than 2 armies, and the territory needs to have a border with the territory you want to attack. Once the territories are selected, a dice roll is conducted and whoever has the highest roll wins for the round. This keeps going until one player takes over the entire campus.
