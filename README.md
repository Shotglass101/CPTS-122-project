Basic Overview: 
The file labeled "text_based_risk - Copy" is a version of the game without the graphics, because the graphics turned out to be a lot harder than we anticipated it would be. The game is in the terminal, and it goes through PLayer 1 and Player 2's turns until one player gets all the territories available.
